## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Client: **`tailwind-merge`** in **`cn()`** (`@/lib/cn`) so shared `Button` / layout classes resolve conflicting Tailwind utilities correctly.
- Client: **`@types/node`** (dev) for tests that read **`index.css`** from disk; **`reader-typography-css.guard.test.ts`** asserts immersive bottom-pad token and verse-row reader font CSS; **`App.test`** covers immersive chrome hide-on-scroll / show-on-long-press and verse **`reader-size-*`** classes from stored prefs.
- Reader: **Immersive full screen** — chapter controls moved to a **bottom** bar with safe-area padding; **Exit full screen** stays hidden until a **long press** on the reading surface (~550ms, with scroll slop) or a **timeout** (immediate when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`). Telemetry: `reader_immersive_exit_revealed` with `reason: 'long_press' | 'timeout'`. New chapter loads **scroll to top** when there is no saved scroll offset for that chapter key (fixes next/previous leaving the viewport scrolled). See **`docs/proposals/reader-immersive-chrome-scroll.md`**.
- Client: **Global Bible translation** preference in **`localStorage`** (`app:preferred-translation:v1`); Support, Search, and Reader stay aligned. Reader seeds from `translation` in the URL once when unset, then the saved preference overrides shared links. Outbound **Study online** links (Bible.com + BibleGateway) on Support replace the inline Learn context panel; tutorial copy and dark-mode styles for tutorial prose/callouts updated. See **`docs/proposals/translation-support-tutorial-study-links.md`**.
- Reader: **Reader tools** sheet (bottom sheet on narrow viewports, centered modal on `md+`) with **Full screen** (Fullscreen API + fixed overlay fallback) and **Reader options** when comfort is enabled; click chapter scroll area opens tools without triggering verse actions (`stopPropagation` on verses). Telemetry: `reader_mobile_tools_*`, `reader_fullscreen_entered` / `reader_fullscreen_exited`. See **`docs/proposals/reader-mobile-fullscreen.md`**.
- Reader: **Full screen** stays active while **previous/next chapter** loads (immersive shell no longer unmounts on `isLoading`); in-immersive loading hint and disabled chapter nav until the fetch finishes.
- Reader: **Verse actions** and **note** modals stack above immersive full screen (`z-[70]`) so full screen is kept; **Reader options** (from **Reader tools**) / setting-help still exit immersive so those dialogs remain usable.
- Reader: verse/note modals are **portaled inside the immersive shell** so they appear during **native** browser fullscreen (only the fullscreen element’s subtree is visible to the compositor).
- Client: **`viewport-fit=cover`** on the root viewport meta for safe-area insets with immersive reader.
- Client: **`jest-axe`** + **`@types/jest-axe`**; **`src/app-a11y.test.tsx`** — axe smoke after guest entry for Support, Search, Reader (John 3 / KJV), and Tutorial (no **serious** or **critical** violations; color-contrast limited under jsdom per jest-axe).

### Changed

- Reader: **Reader tools** on the chapter card uses the **primary** button style and a larger label so it reads as the main action.
- Reader: **Verse** reading style applies **Reader options → Font size** (and line height) to each verse row by setting typography from the same CSS variables as the chapter text.
- Reader: Removed the top-of-page **Options** button; **Reader tools** → **Reader options** is the only in-page entry to reader comfort settings on `/reader`.
- Reader: **Immersive** scrollable column uses **`--reader-immersive-bottom-chrome-pad`** on **`.reader-immersive-shell`** (see **`index.css`**) instead of a magic `5.25rem` only in JSX; bottom chrome uses **`aria-hidden`** when visually hidden.
- Reader: Programmatic-scroll suppress uses a **generation counter** so stacked **`scheduleClearImmersiveChromeScrollSuppress`** double-`rAF` callbacks do not clear the flag early; **`pageshow`** restore sets suppress only when **immersive** is active.
- Reader: **Immersive full screen** bottom chapter bar **hides while scrolling** and stays hidden until the user **long-presses the reading surface** again (no timed auto-show after scroll ends); a short tap or scroll gesture does not reveal chrome.
- Reader: Verse / standard / clean **sup** markers use **`em`**-based sizes so they scale with reader body text.
- Support (**Emotions** home + **emotion scripture** viewer): **dark mode** forces light ink (**`#f8fafc`**) for emotion theme utilities (`text-indigo-*`, `text-red-*`, etc.) via **`.emotion-support-page`** so copy stays readable on the dark shell (global dark rules only rewrote **`text-slate-*`** before).
- GitHub Actions: **`.github/workflows/main.yml`** runs **`pnpm run lint`**, **`tsc`**, **`test`**, then **`build`** before EC2 rsync (parity with PR CI).
- Server: **`readEmotionScripturesBySlug`** batches primary-translation verse rows in **one** `OR` query, then falls back per row for incomplete hits or translation fallback (`emotion-service`).
- Server: Reader cross-book **prev/next** uses **grouped** `min`/`max` chapter queries over candidate books instead of sequential per-book aggregates (`reader-service`).
- Client: **`TutorialPage`** loads each tutorial MDX section with **`React.lazy`** and **`Suspense`** so sections code-split in production.

### Documentation

- **`docs/proposals/reader-immersive-chrome-scroll.md`** — immersive bottom bar / **Exit full screen** re-show via **long press** (not a simple tap); telemetry reasons **`long_press`** and **`timeout`**; scroll slop cancels the long-press timer.
- **`docs/emotion-high-contrast-spot-check.md`** — manual checklist for Support / emotion scripture routes with **High contrast**; **`docs/README.md`** index entry added.
- **`docs/development-workflow.md`** — _GitHub: branch protection (`main`)_; _EC2 / `pub` deploy_ documents **lint / tsc / test / build** on deploy; diagnostics `curl` still references deployment guide for Bearer token.
- **`docs/README.md`** — index note for branch protection + `pub` deploy; testing entry mentions **`app-a11y.test.tsx`** (jest-axe).
- Plans: **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — findings **F1–F9** addressed (**F4–F7** closed with code changes; slices 3–5 tables updated).
- Deployment / security docs: **`docs/deployment/README.md`** — _Admin API authentication_ (scripture diagnostics **Bearer `TOKEN_SECRET` JWT**, ops-only / not SPA; session **admin** for users/events/role); example token + `curl`.
- Saved scriptures: **`docs/verse-search-save.md`** — guest **`x-device-id`** threat model; endpoint note points to deployment auth section.
- **`docs/configuration.md`** — safety note linking guest saves + device id to verse-search-save.
- **`docs/styleguide/backend-observability-security.md`** — admin route auth split (scripture-sources vs `requireAdminSession`).

### Fixed

- Reader: chapter picker on small screens no longer defaults the `<select>` to chapter **1** when the chapter number field is empty while the loaded chapter is something else; URL sync for book/chapter/translation updates the query string only when those values change (preserves `verse` and other params). Hydration from the URL runs only when `searchParams` change so local book/chapter/translation changes are not overwritten by a stale query string before it updates. URL hydration uses functional `setState` only when parsed params differ, and the URL-write effect skips `setSearchParams` when the query already matches state, to avoid update churn that could freeze the tab.

### Documentation

- Proposals: **`docs/proposals/full-application-review.md`** — phased full-stack review scope (code/docs cleanup, FE/BE optimization, functionality and test gaps, security, a11y, supply chain, telemetry, CI/release); listed in **`docs/proposals/README.md`**.
- Plans: **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — review progress tracker (Slice 1: SPA routes, API/client parity, journey matrix, initial finding on admin scripture-sources); **`docs/plans/backend-db-review-inventory.md`** updated with prayer API rows, admin role patch, and SPA client list.
- Plans: **Slice 2** (security / authz / IDOR) recorded in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — session vs router middleware, API access classes, saved/prayer/reader ownership notes, findings **F2** (dual admin auth: Bearer vs session admin) and **F3** (device id threat model for guest saves).
- Plans: **Slice 3** (backend queries / transactions / indexes) in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — transaction inventory (saved scriptures, prayer, admin role), alignment with **`docs/styleguide/database-constraints.md`**, reader vs emotion query notes; findings **F4** (emotion list N parallel verse fetches), **F5** (reader cross-book scan, P4).
- Plans: **Slice 4** (frontend abstractions / perf) in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — lazy routes vs eager shell, centralized `api-client`, reader URL sync + Search sessionStorage, Reader abort/cancel patterns vs ad hoc effects; finding **F6** (tutorial static MDX imports, P4).
- Plans: **Slice 5** (a11y / telemetry / deps) in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — modal/focus/reduced-motion patterns, full `trackEvent` inventory vs styleguide + reader comfort tests, `pnpm audit` workflow + `onlyBuiltDependencies`; finding **F7** (no axe/Playwright a11y automation, P4).
- Plans: **Slice 6** (code + docs cleanup) in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — TODO/FIXME absent in app sources, eslint-disable triage, large-page pointers; **README** + **`docs/configuration.md`** aligned with actual **`install:env`** / **`postinstall`** (removed nonexistent **`setup:env`** / **`validate:env`**); **`docs/architecture.md`** route summary + **`docs/README.md`** testing section.
- Plans: **Slice 7** (CI / release hygiene) in **`docs/plans/full-app-review-2026.md`** — **`ci.yml`** jobs vs local parity, advisory audit workflow, **`main.yml`** EC2 **`pub`** path vs quality gates; findings **F8** / **F9** closed in **`docs/development-workflow.md`** runbook sections.

### Changed

- `docs/development-workflow.md`: local dev step no longer claims **`pnpm run dev`** runs bundled env-file validation; CI section notes **PR-only** triggers and branch-protection guidance.
- README and `docs/configuration.md`: local env setup documents **`pnpm run install:env`** (and root **`postinstall`**) plus optional **`client/.env.local`** copy from **`client/.env.example`**; removed references to nonexistent **`setup:env`**, **`setup:env:force`**, and **`validate:env`**.
- `docs/architecture.md`: authenticated route summary points to full surface in `client/src/App.tsx` (prayer, shared verse, etc.).
- `docs/README.md`: **Testing** subsection links **`docs/development-workflow.md`** and client/server test entry commands.
- Server: `errorMiddleware` maps common `DrizzleQueryError` + Postgres codes (`3D000` missing database, `42P01` missing relation, `08*` connection class) to **503** with actionable messages instead of a generic 500; `docs/development-workflow.md` troubleshooting for `/api/emotions` failures.
- UI: Display settings adds **Reading colors** (Light / Sepia / Dark) mirroring Reader → Options → Theme (`saveReaderPreferences`); Cancel restores the theme from when the modal opened; link to Reader for font/spacing options. Tutorial + Reader Options help text updated.
- UI: `ReaderSurface` uses `reader-content` (theme background + border) so Support and Saved verse blocks show sepia/light/dark reader colors correctly in app dark mode; `index.css` prevents merged slate utilities from overriding embedded reader borders and verse text color.
- UI: shared `Input` skips default full-width classes for `type="checkbox"` / `type="radio"` so inline toggles (e.g. Display settings) stay compact.
- Reader: `buildReaderChapterQuery` / `translationForReaderChapter`; Full Context and Support show an informational toast when opening Reader with a translation the app does not bundle (KJV, ASV, WEB only).
- Reader: hybrid reading UX — Support (`EmotionScripturePage`) and Saved book detail wrap verse text in `ReaderSurface` (live reader theme prefs via `reader-preferences-changed`); chapter controls stack on small screens with a chapter `<select>` on mobile; saved verses in a chapter show distinct highlighting in `ReaderChapterContent`; opening Reader from Support shows a **Support verse** callout (`ReaderSupportVerseCallout`). Full Context **Read full chapter** opens in-app Reader; **Open on BibleGateway** remains secondary. Shared `buildReaderChapterSearchParams` / `resolveReaderChapterLocation`; `saveReaderPreferences` dispatches same-tab sync event; `readerPreferencesClassNames` helper.
- Prayer list detail: removing a member requires `ConfirmModal` confirmation; member rows and notes use `min-w-0` / `break-words` for large text; prayer partners hub cards and forms tightened similarly. App `main` and shared `Input` use `min-w-0` / full width to reduce horizontal overflow.
- Devcontainer: added `name`, JSONC notes on local-open + `workspaceFolder` bind mount; README clarifies opening the local clone before **Reopen in Container**.
- Client: after logging a prayer list session, dispatch `app:prayer-insights-invalidate` so hub pages refresh streak/insights data (`prayer-insights-events.ts`, `usePrayerPageInsights`).
- UI: prayer insights load-error line uses `prayer-insights-inline-status` for dark mode + high contrast in `client/src/index.css`.
- Client: track `client/src/features/prayer/*` (insights API, hooks, hub bar, filter modal shell, reminder modal) used by prayer hub pages.
- UI: shared labeled `Select` primitive (`client/src/components/ui/Select.tsx`) for prayer filter modals; styleguide note under Form and Selector Consistency.
- Prayer hub hardening: IANA timezone validation for reminders (`server/lib/iana-timezone.ts`, Zod `superRefine` + service defense-in-depth; explicit `UTC`/`GMT` aliases because Node may omit them from `Intl.supportedValuesOf`); shared `usePrayerPageInsights` + `PrayerFilterModalShell`; toast + `role="status"` when insights fail; `trackEvent('prayer_reminder_settings_saved')`; deploy smoke check for `GET /api/prayer/insights` without session; route tests for auth/validation edges; styleguide/database docs updated.
- Prayer Partners and Prayer Lists pages: roster/list filters moved into a **Filters** modal; added a shared **Streaks & reminders** card (UTC-day streaks from list sessions, in-app daily reminder settings); improved mobile stacking and touch targets for actions.
- Cursor rules: added examples to `honest-feedback-on-ideas`; clarified scope, cross-links, and doc pointers across pre-commit, release, secrets, auth, API, DB, and frontend rules; added rule-relationship map to `docs/rules-registry.md`.
- Cursor rules: aligned with current stack (reader/CSS guardrails, `features/` layout, `asyncHandler`/validation, MSW handlers, auth-audit contracts, NOT VALID/VALIDATE, VITE rollout, audit workflow).

### Added

- Server: root scripts `db:sync:bible-sources`, `db:import:bible-json`, `db:import:bible-translations`; `db:import:bible-translations` loads bundled `server/data/bible/{kjv,asv,web}.json` into `scripture_verses`; shared `bible-corpus-db-import` + `bible-json-map-reference`; Reader chapter API falls back to local JSON when the DB is missing or has no rows for that translation; `server/data/bible/README.md` and `server/.env.example` notes for corpus workflows; admin `GET /api/admin/scripture-sources` includes `readerChapterBundledFallback`; `docs/deployment/README.md` pre-deploy runs `db:import:bible-translations`; `local-bible-reader-chapter.test.ts` for bundled Genesis 1 + chapter bounds.
- Client: tutorial MDX for **Learn context**, **Display settings**, and **Prayer partners & lists** (`07`–`09` sections); expanded Saved + Support copy; Support home links to `/tutorial`; `SettingHelpButton` + `SettingHelpModal` on Prayer hub/detail pages, Full Context, Shared Verse, and **Saved** index; prayer partner/list **Delete** and partner **note Delete** use `ConfirmModal` instead of `window.confirm`; `ConfirmModal` supports `confirmPendingLabel`, `titleId`, and default busy label **Removing…**; tutorial wrap-up reminders for Display + Prayer; styleguide note; `App.test.tsx` coverage for tutorial link, Saved help, and prayer partner + list delete confirms.
- Client: session `sessionStorage` route snapshots for Search, Saved index, and Prayer Partners (`client/src/lib/route-session-state.ts`); reader last location + chapter scroll persistence (`last-reader-location.ts`, `ReaderNavLinkButton`, `BibleReaderPage`); tutorials as MDX with thin components (`client/src/content/tutorial/sections/*.mdx`, `client/src/components/tutorial/*`, `@mdx-js/rollup` + `eslint-plugin-mdx`); `public/tutorial/` placeholder + README for screenshots.
- Client: route snapshots for **Saved book detail**, **Prayer partner detail**, **Prayer list detail** (scroll; list detail also restores add-member selection + prayer note draft); **cross-tab** last reader via `localStorage`; tutorial MDX split into numbered sections + `TutorialFigure` WebP-first with SVG fallback; tests for `route-session-state`, `ReaderNavLinkButton`, and last-reader localStorage.
- Prayer insights and reminders: migration `0018_user_prayer_settings.sql` + `user_prayer_settings` table (Drizzle + `database/schema.sql` parity); `GET /api/prayer/insights` and `PATCH /api/prayer/settings`; shared contracts in `shared/prayer-contracts.ts`; client modules under `client/src/features/prayer/` (insights API, reminder hook, modals, hub bar); route tests in `server/routes/prayer-api.test.ts`.
- Prayer List feature foundation:
  - shared contracts in `shared/prayer-contracts.ts`
  - schema + SQL parity updates for `prayer_partners`, `prayer_lists`, `prayer_list_members`, `prayer_sessions`, and `prayer_partner_notes`
  - migration `database/migrations/0017_prayer_partners_lists_foundation.sql` with journal update
  - backend prayer API routes/controllers/services for partner/list CRUD, note CRUD, list membership management (including reorder), and session logging
  - frontend routes/pages for Prayer Partners and Prayer Lists (including detail flows for notes, member ordering, and pray-now session logging)
  - backend route coverage in `server/routes/prayer-api.test.ts`
- Added Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/collaborative-flexibility-and-checkins.mdc` to codify strict invariants with implementation flexibility and mandatory user check-ins before meaningful scope/behavior changes.
- Reader comfort Phase 3–4 tracking and gates: `docs/plans/reader-comfort-phase-3-4.md`, `reader-comfort-telemetry.ts` (+ unit tests) for rollout event payload shape, Reader Options note for global high contrast, and Vitest coverage (high contrast + reader theme classes, reduced motion class, app text scale with reader, telemetry privacy).
- Added `docs/styleguide/backend-observability-security.md` (logging, rate limits, health/ready, security checklist, seeds/audit notes).
- Added `.github/workflows/audit-scheduled.yml` (weekly + manual `pnpm audit --audit-level high`, advisory).
- Added route test for invalid `sourceMode` on POST `/api/saved-scriptures`.
- Added migrations `0015_validate_reader_saved_check_constraints.sql` and `0016_saved_scripture_chapter_scope_indexes.sql` (journal updated).
- Added `docs/styleguide/database-constraints.md` (DB ↔ Zod ↔ contract parity; index/query notes for `scripture_verses` and saved items).
- Added `SavedScriptureSourceMode` in `shared/saved-scripture-contracts.ts` for `sourceMode` fields.
- Added `shared/auth-audit-contracts.ts` as the single source for auth audit `eventType` / `outcome` literals (aligned with DB checks; re-exported from `admin-contracts`).
- Added `server/lib/scripture-verse-row.ts` (`mapScriptureVerseRow`) plus `server/lib/scripture-verse-row.test.ts` for shared reader + search verse mapping.
- Added `parsePersistedScriptureTranslation` and `normalizeReaderBookmarkFields` in `server/lib/scripture-normalization.ts` with unit tests in `server/lib/scripture-normalization.test.ts`.
- Added `server/lib/async-handler.ts` for consistent `next(err)` on async route failures; optional `onError` for structured logging.
- Added `server/lib/validation/pagination.ts` (`adminPaginationQuerySchema`, `normalizeAdminPaginationQuery`) for admin list endpoints.
- Added backend/DB hardening plan and Phase 0 inventory docs:
  - `docs/plans/backend-db-review.md`
  - `docs/plans/backend-db-review-inventory.md`
- Added `server/lib/validation/device-id.ts` (optional `x-device-id` parsing) for reuse across device-scoped APIs.
- Added optional `PG_POOL_MAX` env (default 10) and explicit pool `idle` / `connection` timeouts in `server/db/pool.ts`.

### Changed

- `docs/development-workflow.md`: troubleshooting for local `db:migrate` when Drizzle re-runs early migrations (`already exists` / journal out of sync).

### Fixed

- Local Auth0 + default Vite dev: documented and startup-warned when `AUTH_REDIRECT_URI` uses `:8080` but `CORS_ORIGIN` is `:5173` — the OIDC state cookie is stored for the SPA origin during proxied `/api/auth/login`, so the callback URL must match that origin (typically `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback`) unless the client uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointed at `:8080`.
- Local OIDC callback: build the code-exchange callback URL from `AUTH_REDIRECT_URI` (not `req.protocol`) and only enable Express `trust proxy` in production, avoiding wrong `https` detection from forwarded headers that could break Auth0 token exchange.
- Prayer partner image validation now rejects base64/data URLs with explicit guidance to use hosted `http(s)` URLs, and frontend prayer partner forms now block unsupported image inputs before submit.
- Saved scripture batch/note error logging no longer referenced a removed helper (could surface as 500 on some error paths).

### Changed

- `docs/development-workflow.md`: CI parity table vs `ci.yml`, audit workflow pointer, transaction reminder.
- `docs/styleguide/backend-patterns.md`: rate-limit tunables + link to observability doc.
- Partial indexes on `saved_scripture_items` for authenticated vs device chapter queries; Drizzle schema and `database/schema.sql` aligned.
- Saved scripture API: `sourceMode` validated with `z.enum(['local', 'remote'])`; `toSavePayload` and grouped display mapping use shared source-mode types.
- `docs/development-workflow.md`: schema change / NOT VALID / EXPLAIN playbook; `database-patterns.md` links to `database-constraints.md`.
- Reader state service: bookmark read/patch uses shared scripture normalization; invalid bookmark book on patch returns 400; DB rows with unknown books or translations surface as no bookmark when read.
- Saved scripture service: persist and query by canonical Bible book name; translation normalization uses `normalizeScriptureTranslationCode`.
- Emotion service: translation fallback order derives from `SUPPORTED_SCRIPTURE_TRANSLATIONS`.
- Auth audit service and admin types consume `shared/auth-audit-contracts.ts`; Drizzle schema documents parity with that module.
- Scripture search (local DB) and reader chapter responses use `mapScriptureVerseRow` for verse payloads.
- Refactored admin, saved-scripture, emotion, and reader-state controllers to use `asyncHandler`; admin pagination uses shared validation module.
- Documented backend operations (health/ready, migrations, pool tuning, transactions, `pnpm audit`) in `docs/development-workflow.md`.
- Extended `docs/styleguide/backend-patterns.md` with Zod validation conventions, `asyncHandler`, pagination helpers, backend optimization-run triggers, and links to the plan docs.
- `PATCH /api/reader/state` validation errors now use the same Zod → error-middleware path as other endpoints (`details` as `issues`).

  - `client/src/features/reader/ReaderChapterControls.tsx`
  - integrated into `client/src/pages/BibleReaderPage.tsx` without behavior changes.

  - `client/src/features/reader/useReaderVerseActions.ts`
  - integrated into `client/src/pages/BibleReaderPage.tsx` for save/note/share action orchestration and modal state management.
- Added reader status/break reminder presentation extractions:
  - `client/src/features/reader/ReaderStatusBar.tsx`
  - `client/src/features/reader/ReaderBreakReminder.tsx`
  - integrated into `client/src/pages/BibleReaderPage.tsx` without behavior changes.

  - `server/lib/scripture-normalization.ts`
  - shared canonical Bible-book aliasing and translation-code normalization used by scripture search, reader, and emotion services.
- Added centralized reader-preferences validation/normalization module:
  - `server/lib/reader-state-preferences.ts`
  - reused by reader-state controller and service to reduce contract drift risk.
- Added DB hardening migration:
  - `database/migrations/0014_reader_saved_constraints.sql`
  - introduces `NOT VALID` checks for `saved_scripture_items.sourceMode` and `reader_state.bookmarkTranslation`.

- Added Phase 5 regression coverage:
  - reader next-chapter route behavior in `client/src/App.test.tsx`
  - grouped batch-save + note-edit flow coverage in `client/src/App.test.tsx`
  - note patch missing-row (`404`) and empty batch validation (`400`) in `server/routes/scripture-saved-api.test.ts`
