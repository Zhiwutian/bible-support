All notable changes to this template are documented in this file.

The format is inspired by Keep a Changelog and uses semantic-style version sections for template milestones.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Established backend layering with concrete examples:
  - `server/app.ts` for app composition
  - `server/routes/api.ts` for route modules
  - `server/controllers/hello-controller.ts`
  - `server/controllers/health-controller.ts`
  - `server/services/health-service.ts`
  - `server/db/pool.ts`
- Added `GET /api/health` endpoint demonstrating route -> controller -> service -> db flow.
- Added project documentation set under `docs/`:
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/project-structure.md`
  - `docs/development-workflow.md`
  - `docs/templates/feature-doc-template.md`
- Added CI workflow `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` for pull requests and manual runs.
- Added PR template `/.github/pull_request_template.md` with testing + documentation checklists.
- Added docs-policy CI gate requiring docs updates when application/config files change.
- Added pnpm workspace file: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Added pnpm lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Added full test scaffolding with Vitest across frontend and backend.
- Added frontend unit test setup (`client/src/test/setup.ts`) and sample component test (`client/src/App.test.tsx`).
- Added MSW-based frontend API mock pattern (`client/src/test/handlers.ts`, `client/src/test/server.ts`).
- Added backend sample tests:
  - `server/services/health-service.test.ts` (service unit tests with mocked db layer)
  - `server/routes/api.test.ts` (API route tests via Supertest)
- Added `pnpm run test:changed` for fast local feedback by running only tests related to changed files.
- Added runtime pinning with `.nvmrc` and `engines` in root `package.json`.
- Added server environment validation module (`server/config/env.ts`) using `zod`.
- Added structured logging via `pino` and request logging via `pino-http`.
- Added Drizzle ORM + Drizzle Kit integration with schema/migration scaffolding.
- Added example Drizzle-backed CRUD endpoints for todos (`/api/todos`).
- Added idempotent database seed flow (`pnpm run db:seed`) and starter todo data.

### Changed

- Upgraded development environment:
  - Devcontainer uses Node 22 via feature (`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1`).
  - Devcontainer uses persistent bind mount to `/workspace` from local folder.
- Migrated package management from npm to pnpm:
  - Added `packageManager` in root `package.json`.
  - Converted root scripts to `pnpm` commands.
  - Updated Husky pre-commit to `pnpm exec lint-staged`.
  - Updated CI and deploy workflows to use pnpm setup/install/run.
  - Updated docs and README commands from npm to pnpm.
- Hardened CI/CD and project workflow:
  - Deploy workflow updated to `actions/checkout@v4`.
  - Deploy script changed from force push to normal push (`git push origin main:pub`).
  - Added docs-policy + quality checks in CI pipeline.
- Upgraded major runtime/tooling stacks:
  - React 19 + Vite 7 (`client`)
  - Express 5 (`server`)
  - Node 22 (devcontainer/CI)
  - TypeScript/ESLint ecosystem refresh across root + client
  - Husky v9-compatible prepare/hook behavior
- Refactored server startup into bootstrap/app composition split:
  - `server.ts` now focuses on process startup.
  - `app.ts` handles middleware/routes/static/error wiring.
- Updated Express fallback route for Express 5 compatibility:
  - from `*` to `/{*path}`.
- Updated README to match current stack, setup, CI, docs-policy, and pnpm workflows.
- Updated CI to run tests (`pnpm run test`) alongside lint, typecheck, and build.
- Added minimum coverage thresholds in Vitest configs for frontend and backend.

### Fixed

- Resolved empty workspace issue in devcontainer by introducing explicit workspace bind mount.
- Fixed GitHub Actions failure (`Unable to locate executable file: pnpm`) by adding `pnpm/action-setup` before `actions/setup-node`.
- Removed Husky deprecation warning source by deleting deprecated `/.husky/_/husky.sh` and modernizing hook usage.

### Removed

- Removed npm lockfiles:
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `client/package-lock.json`
  - `server/package-lock.json`

## [2.0.0] - Template Baseline

### Added

- Initial full-stack TypeScript template structure with:
  - React client (`client`)
  - Express server (`server`)
  - PostgreSQL scripts (`database`)
  - deployment workflow scaffold
